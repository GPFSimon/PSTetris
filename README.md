A Good Powershell Tetris Game

There's lots of shell Tetris games, but they're never that good. Here is good version of powershell tetris which has:
- Proper scoring
- Scaling levels
- Hold Queue!! - Shell tetris games always forget Holds! and it's so important in modern Tetris!
- Fast Drop
- Instant Drop
- Score animation
- Stats
- Highscore list
- Pause Menu
- Unneccessary Text to Speech

This is an update on an old Powershell build found here: https://magicmao.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/tetris-in-powershell/
I thought it was great, but it didn't follow modern Tetris elements like levels, speed, drops, holds, score, stats, and Field size. 

You can convert this to an .exe with AHK or PowerShell Studio. I did not upload the .exe because that's just weird on GitHub.
